# Notes
****Models:****
Since Eloquent uses magic getters, I have added @property docblocks to all models. This is because I prefer a complete API be defined for all classes.

****Entities:****
I created entities with aggregates because I prefer to keep the Eloquent ORM models to the data layers only.  
(Paused this work for now)
